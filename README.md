# SEASMap - A small scale Google Maps prototype

An Android application providing shortest distance between two locations in institutional buildings. This was my project for the course 'CSC 210: Data Structures and Algorithms' at Ahmedabad University.

SEASMap is an Android application providing shortest distance between two locations where GPS cannot give accurate results. The core algorithm implemented is Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. The user can create his/her own custom map by marking the nodes or navigate through the default map in the app, i.e. our college campus map. This was my project for the course 'Data Structures and Algorithms'.
